# VehiScanner

A web platform which can extract vehicle attribtes such as License Plate Number, Vehicle Type, Vehicle Colour, etc from CCTV footage of vehicles.

# Description

Vehicle surveillance is traditionally carried out by humans, making it a slow and error-prone process that often delays critical investigations. Nowadays, a fair share of investigations in almost any kind of crime requires law enforcement to track down a vehicle. To address this challenge, a web-based platform is proposed that automates vehicle surveillance and removes human dependency, thereby ensuring greater speed, efficiency, and accuracy. The system allows users to log in, upload videos, and submit them for background processing, where Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques are used to identify key attributes such as vehicle type, license plate number, and color. The results are then displayed on the website along with vehicle images and also sent to the userâ€™s registered email, providing a reliable and fully automated solution for modern law enforcement needs.
